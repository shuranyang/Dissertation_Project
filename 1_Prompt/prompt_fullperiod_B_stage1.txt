**Expert's Strategic Analysis:**

Looking at this assignment problem, I need to prioritize high-priority tasks while managing precedence constraints and worker capabilities.

**Worker Capabilities Assessment:**
- Worker 1: Strong in skill_1 (level 5), moderate skill_2 (level 2). Available all periods. Utilisation bounds: 1.4-19.2 periods (0.07-0.96 × 20).
- Worker 2: Strong in skill_2 (level 4), basic skill_1 (level 1). Available all periods. Utilisation bounds: 0.8-16.4 periods (0.04-0.82 × 20).
- Worker 3: Balanced skills (both at level 2). Available all periods. Utilisation bounds: 0-20 periods (0.0-1.0 × 20).

**Task Duration and Priority Analysis:**
- Task 1: 240 minutes = 1 period (priority 2) - needs skill_2≥3
- Task 2: 480 minutes = 2 periods (priority 1) - needs skill_1≥1, must wait for Task 1
- Task 3: 480 minutes = 2 periods (priority 3) - needs skill_2≥1
- Task 4: 480 minutes = 2 periods (priority 1) - needs skill_2≥1, tight deadline (period 3)
- Task 5: 720 minutes = 3 periods (priority 2) - needs skill_1≥2,skill_2≥1, must wait for Task 4

**Precedence Constraints:**
- Task 2 must wait for Task 1 to complete
- Task 5 must wait for Task 4 to complete

**Assignment Strategy:**
1. **Task 4 (Priority 1, urgent deadline)**: With deadline in period 3, this needs immediate attention. **Skill check**: needs skill_2≥1. Worker 1 (skill_2=2) ✓, Worker 2 (skill_2=4) ✓, Worker 3 (skill_2=2) ✓. Choose Worker 1 as they have good capacity and can handle the deadline pressure. Assign to periods 2-3.

2. **Task 1 (Priority 2, enables Task 2)**: Needs skill_2≥3. **Skill check**: Worker 1 (skill_2=2) ✗, Worker 2 (skill_2=4) ✓, Worker 3 (skill_2=2) ✗. Only Worker 2 qualifies. **Precedence consideration**: Must complete before Task 2 can start. Assign to period 1.

3. **Task 2 (Priority 1, depends on Task 1)**: **Precedence check**: Task 1 completes in period 1, so Task 2 can start from period 2. **Skill check**: needs skill_1≥1. Worker 1 (skill_1=5) ✓, Worker 2 (skill_1=1) ✓, Worker 3 (skill_1=2) ✓. **Capacity constraint**: Worker 1 busy periods 2-3 with Task 4. Choose Worker 1 for remaining periods 6,8 (non-consecutive due to scheduling constraints).

4. **Task 5 (Priority 2, depends on Task 4)**: **Precedence check**: Task 4 completes in period 3, so Task 5 can start from period 4. **Skill check**: needs skill_1≥2 AND skill_2≥1. Worker 1 (skill_1=5,skill_2=2) ✓ but already heavily loaded, Worker 2 (skill_1=1,skill_2=4) ✗ due to skill_1<2, Worker 3 (skill_1=2,skill_2=2) ✓. Choose Worker 3. **Multi-period constraint**: 3 consecutive periods needed, assign periods 4-6.

5. **Task 3 (Priority 3, lowest priority)**: **Skill check**: needs skill_2≥1. All workers qualify. **Capacity optimization**: Use Worker 1's remaining capacity in periods 1,5 to maximize utilization.

**Utilisation Check:**
- Worker 1: 6 periods (within 1.4-19.2 bound) ✓
- Worker 2: 1 period (within 0.8-16.4 bound) ✓  
- Worker 3: 3 periods (within 0-20 bound) ✓

**Final Assignments:**
- Worker 1: Task 3 (periods 1,5), Task 4 (periods 2-3), Task 2 (periods 6,8)
- Worker 2: Task 1 (period 1)
- Worker 3: Task 5 (periods 4-6)
