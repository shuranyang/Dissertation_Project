Based on your strategic analysis from Stage 1, convert it to a JSON solution. Learn from this example of how strategy translates to the required format.

## **EXAMPLE: FROM STRATEGY TO JSON**

**Example Strategy Analysis (excerpt):**
"**Final Assignments:**
- Worker 1: Task 3 (periods 1,5), Task 4 (periods 2-3), Task 2 (periods 6,8)
- Worker 2: Task 1 (period 1)
- Worker 3: Task 5 (periods 4-6)"

**Corresponding JSON Solution:**
```json
{
  "worker_task_period_assignments": [
    [2, 1, 1, 240.0],
    [1, 3, 1, 240.0],
    [1, 4, 2, 240.0],
    [1, 4, 3, 240.0],
    [3, 5, 4, 240.0],
    [1, 3, 5, 240.0],
    [3, 5, 5, 240.0],
    [1, 2, 6, 240.0],
    [3, 5, 6, 240.0],
    [1, 2, 8, 240.0]
  ]
}
```

**Conversion Pattern:**
- Each assignment: [worker_id, task_id, period_id, 240.0]
- Multi-period tasks get separate entries for each period
- Period assignments follow the strategy's scheduling decisions

## **YOUR TASK**

Convert your Stage 1 strategy analysis into the same JSON format:

1. Extract final worker-task-period assignments from your analysis
2. Create one [worker_id, task_id, period_id, 240.0] entry for each period of work
3. Ensure multi-period tasks have consecutive period assignments

**Output only the JSON object - no explanations or additional text.**
