## **SOLUTION GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Extract Assignment Decisions**
From your strategy analysis, identify:
1. **Selected Tasks**: Which tasks you decided to assign (vs. leave unassigned)
2. **Worker Assignments**: Which worker is assigned to each selected task
3. **Period Assignments**: Which specific periods each task is scheduled for
4. **Multi-period Scheduling**: For tasks lasting multiple periods, the consecutive period sequence

### **Step 2: Convert to Assignment Tuples**
For each period where a worker works on a task, create a tuple:
**[worker_id, task_id, period_id, 240.0]**

**Encoding Rules**:
- **worker_id**: Integer (worker's ID from input data)
- **task_id**: Integer (task's ID from input data)  
- **period_id**: Integer (1-based period number when work occurs)
- **240.0**: Fixed value representing 240 minutes of work in that period

**Multi-Period Task Encoding**:
- Create separate tuple for each period of the task
- Use consecutive period_ids
- Keep same worker_id and task_id across all periods

**Examples**:
- **Single-period task**: Worker 2 does Task 5 (1 period) in period 8
  ```
  [2, 5, 8, 240.0]
  ```

- **Multi-period task**: Worker 1 does Task 3 (3 periods) starting period 4
  ```
  [1, 3, 4, 240.0]
  [1, 3, 5, 240.0] 
  [1, 3, 6, 240.0]
  ```

### **Step 3: Systematic Constraint Verification**

Before finalizing, verify each constraint:

**✓ Task Assignment Constraint**:
- Each task appears with at most one worker_id
- No task assigned to multiple workers

**✓ Skill Matching Constraint**:
- For each assignment, confirm assigned worker has all required skills
- Verify skill levels meet or exceed task requirements

**✓ Worker Capacity Constraint**:
- For each period, each worker appears at most once
- No worker double-booked in same period

**✓ Worker Workload Bounds**:
- Count total periods for each worker across all assignments
- Calculate: available_periods = total_periods - len(unavailable), min_periods = min_utilisation × available_periods, max_periods = max_utilisation × available_periods
- Verify: min_periods ≤ actual_periods ≤ max_periods

**✓ Multi-Period Task Constraint**:
- Tasks with duration > 240 minutes have correct number of consecutive assignments
- Same worker_id used for all periods of same task

**✓ Precedence Constraint**:
- For each precedence relationship (A → B), verify A's last period < B's first period
- Check all predecessor-successor pairs

## **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**

Generate the assignment solution as a JSON object with your worker-task-period assignments.

**Assignment Format**:
Each assignment is a 4-element array: `[worker_id, task_id, period_id, 240.0]`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "worker_task_period_assignments": [
    [1, 2, 3, 240.0],
    [1, 2, 4, 240.0],
    [2, 1, 5, 240.0]
  ]
}
```
