You are given a workforce-task assignment problem. The goal is to **maximize the assignment of high-priority tasks** to workers while satisfying all essential constraints.

**CRITICAL**: Any assignment that violates the constraints below is INVALID.

---

## **Problem Setup**

- **Multiple tasks** need to be assigned to **multiple workers** over **multiple time periods**
- Each time period lasts **240 minutes (4 hours)**
- Tasks have different durations measured in **periods** (1 period, 2 periods, 3 periods, etc.)
- Tasks requiring multiple periods must be assigned to the same worker in consecutive periods
- **Primary Objective**: Maximize total priority score = Σ(H - priority_level) × assigned_tasks
  where H = 1 + maximum_priority_level

---

## **Input Data Structure**

### **Tasks Array**
Each task has:
- **id**: Task identifier
- **task_type**: Task type (e.g., "type_1", "type_2")
- **priority**: Priority level (1=highest priority, higher numbers=lower priority)
- **skills**: Required skill levels as key-value pairs
  - Example: `{"skill_1": 4, "skill_3": 3}` means worker needs skill_1 ≥ 4 AND skill_3 ≥ 3
- **duration**: Task duration in minutes (240, 480, 720, etc.)
  - Convert to periods by dividing by 240: duration_periods = duration ÷ 240
- **predecessors**: Array of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start
- **deadline**: Latest period by which task should be completed

### **Workers Array**
Each worker has:
- **id**: Worker identifier
- **preference**: Array of preferred task types (e.g., ["type_1", "type_2"])
- **skills**: Worker's skill levels as key-value pairs
  - Example: `{"skill_1": 5, "skill_2": 2}` means worker has skill_1 at level 5, skill_2 at level 2
- **min_utilisation**: Minimum utilization ratio (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Convert to periods: min_periods = min_utilisation × total_available_periods
- **max_utilisation**: Maximum utilization ratio (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Convert to periods: max_periods = max_utilisation × total_available_periods
- **unavailable**: Array of period indices when worker is not available

## **ESSENTIAL CONSTRAINTS (Must be satisfied)**

### **1. TASK ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINT**
**Rule**: Each task can be assigned to at most one worker.
- No task can be assigned to multiple workers
- Tasks can remain unassigned if beneficial for the objective

### **2. SKILL MATCHING CONSTRAINT**
**Rule**: To be assigned a task, a worker must have all required skills at levels greater than or equal to the task’s required level for that skill.
- For each skill required by the task, worker must possess that skill
- Worker's skill level must be ≥ task's required level for that skill
- Missing any required skill at required level makes the assignment INVALID

### **3. WORKER CAPACITY CONSTRAINT**
**Rule**: Each worker can work on at most one task per period.
- No double-booking: worker cannot be assigned multiple tasks in same period
- Applies to each individual period separately

### **4. WORKER WORKLOAD BOUNDS**
**Rule**: Each worker's total assigned periods must fall within their utilization bounds.
- Calculate available_periods = total_periods - len(unavailable_periods)
- min_periods = min_utilisation × available_periods
- max_periods = max_utilisation × available_periods
- Total assigned periods ≥ min_periods
- Total assigned periods ≤ max_periods

### **5. MULTI-PERIOD TASK CONSTRAINT**
**Rule**: Tasks lasting multiple periods must be assigned consecutively.
- All periods of a multi-period task assigned to same worker
- Periods must be consecutive (no gaps)

### **6. PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINT**
**Rule**: Predecessor tasks must be completed before successor tasks can start.
- If task A is predecessor of task B, A must finish before B starts
- If both assigned to same worker: A's last period < B's first period
- If assigned to different workers: A's last period < B's first period

## **ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

Please conduct a systematic analysis following these steps:

### **Step 1: Worker-Task Eligibility Analysis**
1. **Skill Compatibility Check**:
   - For each task, identify which workers have all required skills at sufficient levels
   - Create eligibility matrix: Task × Worker → Eligible/Not Eligible
   - Document reason for ineligibility (missing skills, insufficient levels)

2. **Capacity Assessment**:
   - For each worker, calculate available_periods = total_periods - len(unavailable)
   - Convert utilisation bounds: min_periods = min_utilisation × available_periods, max_periods = max_utilisation × available_periods
   - For each eligible worker-task pair, check if assignment fits within bounds
   - Account for task duration requirements (duration ÷ 240 periods)

### **Step 2: Priority and Precedence Analysis**
1. **Priority Ranking**:
   - List tasks in priority order (priority 1 = highest value)
   - Calculate priority score contribution for each task: (H - priority_level)
   - Identify high-value tasks that should be prioritized

2. **Precedence Mapping**:
   - Identify all precedence relationships
   - Determine earliest possible start periods for each task
   - Flag any circular dependencies or impossible precedence chains

### **Step 3: Resource Conflict Identification**
1. **Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - Identify workers who are the only option for high-priority tasks
   - Find tasks competing for the same scarce worker skills
   - Assess capacity constraints vs. task demand

2. **Trade-off Assessment**:
   - Compare priority scores of competing tasks
   - Evaluate impact of leaving certain tasks unassigned
   - Consider workload balancing implications

### **Step 4: Assignment Strategy Development**
1. **Task Selection Strategy**:
   - Propose which tasks to assign vs. leave unassigned
   - Justify selections based on priority score maximization
   - Address resource conflicts and bottlenecks

2. **Scheduling Strategy**:
   - Plan worker assignments across periods
   - Ensure precedence constraints are satisfied
   - Optimize for consecutive period allocation for multi-period tasks

3. **Constraint Verification Plan**:
   - Outline how to verify each constraint is satisfied
   - Identify potential violation risks and mitigation strategies
